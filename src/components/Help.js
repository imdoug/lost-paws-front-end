                <h5 className="centered">Lost Dog Poster</h5>
                <p className="centered">To find your missing dog, you have to communicate a lot! The Guide already details everything you have to do, nevertheless, this page describes a very important topic: posters . These posters that you are going to have to place around the place of your dog's loss. They are also called posters, flyers, wanted notices ... in all cases the principle is the same: inform in the most visible way possible of the loss of your animal. This, while giving the essential information to contact you.</p>
                <h5 className="centered">Create a lost dog poster</h5>
                <p className="centered">Luckily, by posting an ad on this site, an important part is already done! On the page of your advertisement, there is indeed a link which allows you to automatically print a poster. So no need for you to start with different software for this part.</p>
                <p className="centered">The essential information is already present and will make a perfect poster template:</p>
                <p className="centered"><i>icon</i>A headline in red clearly visible "LOST DOG"</p>
                <p className="centered"><i>icon</i>Your dog's photo</p>
                <p className="centered"><i>icon</i>A short description with the essential information: color, race, size, sex ... You shouldn't say too much for the poster to remain very visual.</p>
                <p className="centered"><i>icon</i>The place and date of the disappearance. Again, there is no point in being too specific about the location of the disappearance, it will not help. The mere presence of the placard in one place is enough to say that an animal has been lost nearby.</p>
                <h5 className="centered">Print a lost dog poster</h5>
                <p className="centered">As seen above, thanks to your advertisement on the site, you already have a ready-made poster. You must now print it in several copies using your printer. The site is configured so that the poster fits on a single page in A4 format. For economic reasons, you can print only one copy on your home printer and then make photocopies. Depending on the area in which you lost your animal, you will need to make more or less copies: many copies in the city, less in the countryside.</p>
                <p className="centered">Then place about half of the posters in transparent sleeves to protect them from the rain.</p>
                <h5 className="centered">Display</h5>
                <p className="centered">At this point, you have posters in transparent pockets (for places that are not sheltered from the rain), and a stack of posters without pockets (for the inside).</p>
                <p className="centered">Ask bakeries, pharmacies, supermarkets, the Post Office, to put up a poster. They rarely refuse, but sometimes they forget to stick it; so if possible paste it yourself with their permission. Also stick them on permanent waste containers, near cash machines, near letter boxes, and where parents wait when they leave schools. Stick them at crossroads, near pedestrian crossings, sometimes at sight of motorists.</p>
                <p className="centered"><i>icon</i>It is forbidden to stick posters on road signs as well as on their support</p>
                <p className="centered"><i>icon</i>It is forbidden to stick posters on private property!</p>
                <p className="centered"><i>icon</i>Posting outside of billboards is tolerated, but it remains a “wild posting” offense which can be punished with fines. It is important to keep a list of the places where a sign is posted and to remove them all after a certain period of time.</p>
                <p className="centered">Finally, when you meet acquaintances or neighbors, do not hesitate to hand him a poster. You never know, they may have seen it, or will see it.</p>
                <p className="centered">Note: you can also display in the case of a found dog. In the same way as for a lost dog, the site allows you to automatically print a poster for a found dog.</p>
